## Open questions
* How are the different tiers supposed to interact? The description implies that the tiers will be built on top of each other, but the given code seems to contradict this.
* Are we going to be distributing the data at the array level or at the dataframe level? Essentially we are wondering if the long term plan is to distribute the schema as well or have the "home node" be responsible for the schema and just distribute the data itself.
